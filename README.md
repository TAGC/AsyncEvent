## AsyncEvent

[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/AsyncEvent.svg)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/AsyncEvent)
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/3muupptlanmaspyc?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/TAGC/asyncevent)

AsyncEvent is a small library that defines a delegate representing asynchronous event handlers, as well as extension methods
for this delegate that can be used to fire events asynchronously.

To use this library, define an event based on `AsyncEventHandler` or `AsyncEventHandler<TEventArgs>` and call `InvokeAsync` to fire it. `InvokeAsync` returns a task that represents the work done by all registered subscribers to the event, and will only complete when all subscribers have finished handling the event. Additionally, any exceptions that occur while the event is being handled will be propagated back to the context in which the event was fired.

One thing worth pointing out is that, with the current implementation, all registered delegates are run concurrently in a non-deterministic order when an event is fired. By comparison, synchronous event handlers run delegates sequentially in a deterministic order.

### Installation

This package is available on NuGet and can be installed from there. For example, using the dotnet CLI:

```
dotnet add package AsyncEvent
```

### Usage

Define a class with asynchronous event handlers like this:

```cs
using AsyncEvent;

public class Thermometer
{
    public event AsyncEventHandler<TemperatureChangedEventArgs> TemperatureChanged;

    private Task OnTemperatureChanged(double newTemperature) =>
        TemperatureChanged.InvokeAsync(this, new TemperatureChangedEventArgs { Temperature = newTemperature });
}

public class TemperatureChangedEventArgs : EventArgs
{
    public double Temperature { get; set; }
}
```

Then create a callback to asynchronously handle these events:

```cs
public class TemperatureRecorder
{
    private readonly ITemperatureDatabase _database;

    public TemperatureRecorder(Thermometer thermometer, ITemperatureDatabase database)
    {
        _database = database;
        thermometer.TemperatureChanged += RecordNewTemperature;
    }

    private async Task RecordNewTemperature(object sender, TemperatureChangedEventArgs eventArgs)
    {
        var temperature = eventArgs.Temperature;
        var currentTime = DateTime.Now;

        await _database.AddRecord(currentTime, temperature);
    }
}
```

#### Interop with synchronous event handlers

AsyncEvent is meant to allow the specification of events that may need to be handled asynchronously. However, there's potentially a lot of cases where this handling can be purely synchronous, such as if clients simply want to log the event.

AsyncEvent exposes utility functions that allow synchronous event handlers to be adapted for use with asynchronous events. To make use of these, add `using static AsyncEvent.Extensions` in the source code, then wrap synchronous event handlers in `Async(...)` or `Async<TEventArgs>(...)`. For example:

```cs
using static AsyncEvent.Extensions;

// ...

thermometer.TemperatureChanged += Async<TemperatureChangedEventArgs>(
    (s, e) => Console.WriteLine($"New temperature: {e.Celcius}Â°C"));
```

The adapted event handler will perform the same logic as the synchronous event handler and return a completed task.
